1. Authentication and Authorization 

Integration with Firebase Admin: Implement backend services using Firebase Admin SDK to manage users, roles, and permissions.

Role-Based Authentication: Define four distinct roles: Admin, Vendor, Client, and Driver.

Advanced Middleware: Create middleware functions to verify user roles and enforce access control for protected routes.


2. User Management

Registration and Profiles: Enable registration for different user roles, each with a unique set of data fields and validation rules.

Implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, token-based user authentication.

User password encryption techniques to ensure the safety of user credentials.

User CRUD Operations: Allow for adding, updating, and retrieving user information.

Address Management: Provide functionality for users to add, update, and retrieve addresses.

Implement logic to maintain a single default address per user, with the ability to change the default setting.


3. Vendor-Specific Features

Vendor Registration: Set up a registration process for vendors, including the collection of necessary information and validation.

Vendor Middleware: Ensure that only vendors can access routes for managing their shop and drink items.

Drink Management: Develop endpoints for vendors to upload and manage their drink items.


4. Recommendations and Dynamic Content

Location-Based Shop Recommendations: Create endpoints that suggest shops to clients based on their current location.
